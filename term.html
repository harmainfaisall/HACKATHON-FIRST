                        app:</p>

                    <p class="text-white-50">There is certain content we can't allow on the app.</p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">We want our users to be able to express themselves as much as possible and
                        post all sorts of things on the app, but we have to impose restrictions on certain content
                        which:</p>

                        <li>contains language or imagery which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset,

                        <li>is obscene, pornographic, violent or otherwise may offend human dignity;</li>
                        <li>is abusive, insulting or threatening, discriminatory or which promotes or encourages racism,
                            sexism, hatred or bigotry;</li>
                        <li>encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial
                            hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;</li>
                        <li>is defamatory or libellous;</li>
                        <li>relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and
                            advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);</li>
                        <li>involves the transmission of "junk" mail or "spam";</li>
                        <li>contains any spy ware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious
                            code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software,
                            hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any
                            other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-white mt-4 mb-3">Your Content</h4>
                    <p class="text-white-50">You are free to post all the fun stuff you want on the app, but please, no
                        nudes, no spam, no scams. And please, be nice to others! We want our community to be a safe and
                        fun place for everyone.</p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">Your content will be visible to other users of the app, so make sure you

                    <p class="text-white-50">Other members will also share content on the app. Member Content belongs to
                        the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed via the App at the
                        direction of the user providing the Member Content.</p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">You do not have any rights in relation to other users' Member Content, and
                        you may only use other users' personal information to the extent that your use matches the app's
                        purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users' information for
                        commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to
                        terminate your account if you misuse other users' information.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">4. Disclaimer</h3>
                    <p class="text-white-50">The materials on Down's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Down
                        makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties
                        including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for
                        a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
                        Further, Down does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely
                        results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such
                        materials or on any sites linked to this site.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">5. Limitations</h3>
                    <p class="text-white-50">In no event shall Down or its suppliers be liable for any damages
                        (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business
                        interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Down's website, even
                        if Down or a Down authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
                        possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                        warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
                        limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">6. Control</h3>

                        written consent, which may be withheld in Down's sole discretion; (2) use or attempt to use any
                        engine, software, tool, agent, or other device or mechanism (including without limitation
                        browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Site, other
                        than the search engines and search agents available through the Site and other than generally
                        available third-party web browsers (such as Microsoft Explorer); (3) post or transmit any file
                        which contains viruses, worms, Trojan horses or any other contaminating or destructive features,
                        or that otherwise interferes with the proper working of the Site; or (4) attempt to decipher,
                        decompile, disassemble, or reverse-engineer any of the software comprising or in any way making
